There is a Git server used by the Nautilus project teams. Recently a new developer Jon joined the team and needs to
start working on a project. To do so, he needs to fork an existing Git repository. Below you can find more details:

Click on the Gitea UI button on the top bar. You should be able to access the Gitea page.

Login to Gitea server using username jon and password Jon_pass123.
