## Create Namespaces in Kubernetes Cluster

### Problem

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to deploy some micro services on Kubernetes platform. The team has already set up a
Kubernetes cluster and now they want set up some namespaces, deployments etc. Based on the current requirements, the
team has shared some details as below:

Create a namespace named dev and create a POD under it; name the pod dev-nginx-pod and use nginx image with latest tag
only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
