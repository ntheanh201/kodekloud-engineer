## Linux Banner

### Problem

During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid
banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain
compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.

Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located
at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host
